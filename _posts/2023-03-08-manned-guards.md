A human presence on your vacant property, construction site or business premises is an ideal way to deter any would-be intruders and de-escalate situations. Manned guarding is crucial for a number of reasons. This post will explore some of the facts about manned guarding.

## What is Manned Guarding?
Manned guarding simply means that you have humans (and dog handlers if required) patrolling and monitoring your property in case of criminal activity. Manned guarding is proven to prevent a lot of break-ins,  vandalism, kidnapping and theft.

It also offers a heightened feeling of security for your staff and customers. Having a trained professional on hand in case of an emergency can be extremely comforting.

## Are There Different Types of Manned Guarding?
In short, yes. You can opt for a guard who will be present from 9-5 each day, during working hours, or a highly trained guard that’s on site 24 hours a day. The type of manned guarding you opt for depends on your business’ needs.

## What Can Manned Guards Do?
While manned guards are highly trained in de-escalating situations and will monitor your business, it is important to remember that they are not the police. If your business is a shop, for example, and a guard catches a shoplifter, they are allowed to use a reasonable amount of force to detain the person. Arresting that person, however, is up to the police.
